# Aviation Incident Analysis: Data Science Findings & Project Report

## Executive Summary
This project delivers a fully automated, professional-grade analysis pipeline for post-takeoff aviation incidents. Using advanced data science, NLP, and machine learning, we consolidated, cleaned, and analyzed over 17,000 incidents, generated all key visualizations, and achieved >98% accuracy in binary crash severity prediction (Severe vs. Not Severe) using Random Forest and XGBoost. All results are reproducible via a single Python script.

## 1. Data Collection & Integration
- **Sources:** Multiple CSVs (historical crash records, fatality data, archive datasets)
- **Scope:** 17,768 incidents, 1908–2009, global coverage
- **Process:**
  - Dynamic loading of all CSVs in `data/`
  - Encoding fixes (UTF-8, Latin-1)
  - Deduplication on key fields
  - Data type validation and conversion

## 2. Data Cleaning & Exploration
- **Missing Data:** Quantified and visualized missingness for all columns
- **Date Handling:** Unified date columns, extracted year, filtered invalid dates
- **Fatality Calculation:** Summed all fatality-related columns to create `Total_Fatalities`
- **Flight Type Classification:** NLP and keyword-based rules to assign Commercial, Military, Private
- **Text Preprocessing:**
  - Cleaned summaries (lowercase, remove numbers/punctuation, stemming, stopword removal)
  - Created `Summary_Clean` for NLP analysis

## 3. NLP-Based Cause Extraction
- **Keyword Dictionaries:** For each major cause (Mechanical/Engine Failure, Weather, Human Factor, etc.)
- **Enhanced Logic:** Pattern recognition for fallback categorization
- **Output:** Multi-label `Crash_Causes` column for each incident

## 4. Data Visualization
- **Missing Data Barplot:** `missing_data.png`
- **Flight Type Distribution:** `flight_type_distribution.png`
- **Crash Cause Distribution:** `crash_cause_distribution.png`
- **Cause Co-occurrence Heatmap & Network:** `cause_cooccurrence_heatmap.png`, `cause_cooccurrence_network.png`
- **Comprehensive Dashboard:** 9-panel commercial flight dashboard (`commercial_flight_dashboard.png`)
- **Model Metrics:** Confusion matrices, accuracy barplots

## 5. Machine Learning Pipeline
- **Task:** Binary classification (Severe [Fatalities ≥ 1] vs. Not Severe)
- **Features:** Year, Aboard, Operator, Type, Flight Type (encoded)
- **Preprocessing:**
  - Label encoding for categorical features
  - Train/test split (stratified)
- **Models:**
  - Random Forest (n=100, default params)
  - XGBoost (default params, logloss eval)
- **Evaluation:**
  - Accuracy, F1, classification report, confusion matrix
  - All metrics and plots saved in `visualizations/`
- **Results:**
  - Random Forest Accuracy: 98.8%
  - XGBoost Accuracy: 98.5%
  - High precision/recall for "Severe" class (class imbalance noted)

## 6. Reproducibility & Automation
- **Script:** All steps automated in `plane_crash_analysis.py`
- **How to Run:**
  1. Place all data files in `data/`
  2. Install requirements: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
  3. Run: `python plane_crash_analysis.py`
  4. Review outputs in `visualizations/`
- **Requirements:**
  ```
  pandas>=1.5.0
  numpy>=1.21.0
  matplotlib>=3.5.0
  seaborn>=0.11.0
  networkx>=3.0
  nltk>=3.7
  scikit-learn>=1.1.0
  xgboost>=1.6.0
  lightgbm>=3.3.0
  ```

## 7. Limitations & Future Work
- **Class Imbalance:** Most incidents are "Severe"; future work should address this with resampling or alternative metrics
- **Multi-Class Prediction:** Current pipeline is binary; multi-class cause prediction will be explored as more data becomes available
- **Temporal Scope:** Data limited to 2009; integrating modern datasets is a priority
- **Feature Expansion:** More technical and operational features could improve model interpretability and accuracy

## 8. Data Scientist's Notes
- **Best Practices:**
  - All code is modular, reproducible, and version-controlled
  - Data lineage and transformation steps are transparent
  - Visualizations are publication-ready and saved automatically
- **Interpretability:**
  - Feature importances can be extracted from models
  - Confusion matrices and classification reports are provided for transparency
- **Extensibility:**
  - Pipeline can be adapted for new data, new features, or multi-class targets
  - Designed for easy integration with real-time or modern aviation data sources
